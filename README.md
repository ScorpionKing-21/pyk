Hello
this is just a simple key logger.
there are 3 options 
1) This option will capture keys in your defined file in the same folder this file will be.
2) This option is just for fun as it will move your mouse pointer to the area provided by you in pixels.(for example X(300) y(400))
3) This option will capture live mouse position in pixels
for mouse top-left is (0, 0) position.
